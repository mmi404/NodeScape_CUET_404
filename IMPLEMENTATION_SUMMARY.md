## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Graph Data Structure
```typescript
interface Edge {
  id: string;
  source: string;
  target: string;
  type: 'graphEdge';
  data: {
    isDirected: boolean;
    isActive?: boolean;
    isVisited?: boolean;
  };
  markerEnd?: {
    type: 'arrowclosed';
    width: number;
    height: number;
    color: string;
  };
}
```

### Traversal Algorithm Updates
- **BFS/DFS**: Now properly handle directed vs undirected graphs
- **Adjacency List Building**: Respects edge direction based on graph type
- **Path Generation**: Considers graph direction for accurate traversal

### Edge Creation Logic
1. **Directed Mode**: Store connection as one-way link from source to target
2. **Undirected Mode**: Treat connection as bidirectional, prevent reverse duplicates
3. **Visual Direction**: Show arrows for directed edges, plain lines for undirected
4. **Validation**: Prevent self-loops and duplicate edges

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Enhancements

### Node States
- **Default**: Gray nodes for unvisited
- **Current**: Blue nodes with shadow for currently processing
- **Visited**: Green nodes for completed processing
- **Queued**: Yellow pulsing nodes for queued/stacked

### Edge States
- **Default**: Gray edges
- **Active**: Blue dashed edges for current traversal
- **Visited**: Green edges for completed paths
- **Directed**: Arrow markers pointing from source to target

## ðŸ“Š Graph Classification Features

### Supported Classifications
1. **Tree**: Acyclic connected graph with n-1 edges
2. **Cyclic**: Graph containing at least one cycle
3. **DAG**: Directed Acyclic Graph

### Feature Extraction
- Node count, edge count, density
- In-degree and out-degree statistics
- Connectivity analysis (weak/strong components)
- Topological properties
- Clustering coefficients
